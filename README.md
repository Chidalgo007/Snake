As part of my academic endeavors, I developed a classic Snake game that showcased my proficiency in game programming and algorithmic design. </br>
This project utilized a point-based system to establish the snake's movement and position, as well as strategically place apples within the game environment. </br>
By implementing effective data structures and algorithms, such as linked lists for the snake's body segments and random positioning for the apples, I ensured an engaging and responsive gameplay experience. </br>
This endeavor underscored my capability to combine technical skills with creative game mechanics, contributing to my comprehensive understanding of interactive software development.</br>
